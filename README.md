# EXLskills User-system Interaction Tracking Server

## Requirements

You may be able to get away with more/less than what's described below, but we can't recommend anything outside of these options:

Operating Systems:

- Ubuntu 16.04
- OS X 10.13+
- Windows has not been thoroughly tested, although it has worked and should work... Windows-related contributions are welcome

Other Dependencies:

- MongoDB v3.4+ (Recommend v3.6+)
- NodeJS v8.10+
- NPM v6.1+

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/exlskills/usi-server

cd usi-server

npm install
```

## Running

With MongoDB running, start the local server:

```
npm start
```

### Configuration

At startup, the server reads the configuration information from the Operating System's Environment Variables and/or from the `.env` file located in the installation root directory. See [dotenv syntax rules](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#rules) for `.env` formatting. The same format is also generally applicable to [docker environment variables files](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#set-environment-variables--e---env---env-file) that can be used to pass parameters into containers via `--env-file` option and to [docker-compose environment file](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#env_file) 

For local testing or development, copy the sample provided `.default.env` into `.env` and set the necessary values, e.g., set
```
DB_NAME=my_dev
```
